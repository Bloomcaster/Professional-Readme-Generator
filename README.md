# Professional-Readme-Generator

This is a professional README generator that enables the user through the command line render a complete README file for their new application/project. This is done via prompts from the command line that starts with the TITLE of the project and goes through DESCRIPTION, INSTALLATION, USAGE, and asks the user if they would like to add a LICENSE and if there were CONTRIBUTORS to the code. Then the user is prompted to input how to TEST the application/project. Lastly the user must put in their GITHUB information and their EMAIL if they choose to have other users to contact them regarding the project.

Since this project is rendered in the command line I have included a video to dynamically display how the code works. This project uses inquirer() and is accessed with node index.js and package.json is needed so to that the prompts are displayed.
